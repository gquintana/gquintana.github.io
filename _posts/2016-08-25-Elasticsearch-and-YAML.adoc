= Elasticsearch and YAML

Most examples in Elasticsearch documentation are using JSON to represent: documents, requests and responses.
Writing JSON is not that hard but you sometimes become Raiders of the Lost Curly Brace.

Do you know that you could replace JSON by YAML?

== In responses

You can add `format=yaml` in the query params:

----
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/logstash-*/_search?format=yaml

---
took: 13
timed_out: false
_shards:
  total: 15
  successful: 15
  failed: 0
hits:
  total: 2382
  max_score: 1.0
  hits:
  - _index: "logstash-2016.06.22"
    _type: "test"
    _id: "AVV36B3vd6qInGJw3x0r"
    _score: 1.0
    _source:
      '@timestamp': "2016-06-22T11:39:07.431Z"
  - _index: "logstash-2016.06.22"
    _type: "test"
    _id: "AVV36Cfrd6qInGJw3x0u"
    _score: 1.0
    _source:
      '@timestamp': "2016-06-22T11:38:42.000Z"
----

You can also use the `Content-Type: application/yaml` HTTP header:

----
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health

---
cluster_name: "elasticsearch"
status: "yellow"
timed_out: false
number_of_nodes: 1
number_of_data_nodes: 1
...
----

While using YAML format for responses you don't have to use the `pretty=true` query param
as YAML is naturally indented.

== In requests

Just start your request body with `---`:

----
curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_search -d '---
query:
  match:
    message: "Elasticsearch"
'
----

This gets pretty handy when dealing with mappings and settings:

[source,yaml]
.movie.mapping.yaml
----
---
properties:
  title:
    type: string
  tags:
    type: string
    index: not_analyzed
  year:
    type: date
    format: year
----

----
curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/movies/_mappings/movie --data-binary @movie.mapping.yaml
----

== Limits

Some requests like `_bulk` request may not accept YAML.

Sense (Kibana Console) and other Elasticsearch UIs do not handle YAML properly.
