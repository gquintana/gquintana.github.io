:page-description: Logging configuration code snippets for common libraries like Logback or Log4J.

There is nothing fundamentally new in this article.
It's just a quick reminder (to myself) about Java logging framework configuration.

The configuration files will contain:

* Console aka stdout output
* Rolling file output with both date and size rolling policies.
	Rotating the file every day is practical because it allows to find yesterday's failure cause easily.
	Rotating when the file reaches a given size allows to protect against disk flood.
* Sample log patterns to help formating log file.

Logging libraries support multiple configuration file format: XML, Properties, YAML... I chose to use XML, it's a matter of taste.

== Logback

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/logback-config/pom.xml[tags=dependencies]
----
Logback implements SLF4J from the ground up.

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/logback-config/src/main/resources/logback.xml[]
----
<1> The `debug` flag enables Logback startup logs.
<2> The `log.dir` property can be overriden at JVM (`-Dlog.dir=...`) or OS level.
<3> The `pattern` is documented in the https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout[layout] section.
<4> Format the `date` in ISO8601.

You can force Logback to use a specific configuration file using a JVM property `-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml`.

The https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html[Logback Manual] contains detailed information.

== Log4J2

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/log4j2-config/pom.xml[tags=dependencies]
----
The Log4J2-SLF4J adapter is in the Log4J2 group.

.log4j2.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/log4j2-config/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml[]
----
<1> Setting `status` to `trace` or `debug` shows Log4J2 internal logs.
<2> The `logDir` property is set from JVM property (`-Dlog.dir=...`) with default value.
		See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#Property_Substitution[Property substitution] in documentation.
<3> The `PatternLayout` is documented in the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout[layout] section.
<4> Format the `date` in ISO8601.

You can tell Log4J2 to load a specific configuration file using a JVM property `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml`.

The http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html[Log4J2 Manual] contains extensive documentation.

== Log4J1

Even if it's deprecated, let's end with the venerable Log4J v1 library.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/log4j1-config/pom.xml[tags=dependencies]
----
The Log4J1-SLF4J adapter is in the SLF4J group.

.log4j.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{source_dir}/log4j1-config/src/main/resources/log4j.xml[]
----
<1> Like Logback, the `debug` flag enables Log4J1 internal logs.
<2> There aren't any properties in Log4J1.
<3> The `PatternLayout` is documented in the http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html[JavaDoc].
<4> There is no DailyRollingFileAppender in Log4J1 unless you add `log4j-extras` extension.
Even with this extension, one can not mix size and time rollover.
<5> Format the `date` in ISO8601.

You shouldn't forget `file:/` if you use specific configuration file with the JVM property `-Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/config.xml`.

The https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html[Log4J1 Manual] is only a quick introduction. By the time, there was a https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Log4j-Manual-Ceki-Gulcu/dp/2970036908[book] .
