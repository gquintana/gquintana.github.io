:page-description: "How to retrieve Kafka consumer lag with Java API."

This article shows how to get Kafka lag for a given consumer group using the Java API.
It's about implementing part of the `kafka-consumer-group` command line tool in pure Java.

To get consumer lag we will go through several steps:

. Get consumer group current offset, 4 in the above example
. Get topic end offset: the producers offset, 8 in the above example
. Compute the lag: the difference between both

== Getting consumer group offset

Kafka 2.0 introduced an `AdminClient` class which contains a very useful
https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html#listConsumerGroupOffsets-java.lang.String-org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.ListConsumerGroupOffsetsOptions-[listConsumerGroupOffsets] method.
This method returns for a given consumer group a dictionnary _(topic name, partition) -> current offset_

----
Obviously, this solution expects consumer offsets to be stored in Kafka's `__consumer_offsets` topic.
It does not apply, for example, to some Kafka Connect sink implementations which store their lag in the target data store.

The `listConsumerGroupOffsets` is asynchronous and returns a `KafkaFuture` (some kind promise) which implements Java's `Future`.
My code is blocking, there is room for improvement.

To get consumer group Ids, there is a `listConsumerGroups` in the same `AdminClient` class:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/lag/ConsumerLagMain.java[tags=consumerGroupIds]
----

By computing the current offset derivative, we could compute the consumer message rate.

There is another method to get consumer offsets, it is in the consumer client and is named https://kafka.apache.org/24/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#committed-java.util.Set-[committed].
Contrary to `listConsumerGroupOffsets` method, it requires to know the consumed topic partitions.
So it's useless in our case.

== Getting topic end offset

The `KafkaConsumer` class contains an
https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#endOffsets-java.util.Collection-[endOffsets] method
to get the end offset of a topic partition.
It returns a dictionnary _(topic name, partition) -> end offset_

[source, java]

include::{sourcedir}/src/main/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/lag/ConsumerLagMain.java[tags=topicEndOffsets]
----

By computing the end offset derivative, we could compute the producer message rate.

Getting the topic start offset using https://kafka.apache.org/24/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#beginningOffsets-java.util.Collection-[beginningOffsets] method,
we also could compute the topic size per partition.

== Joining offsets and computing lag

Both consumer offsets and topic end offsets are given per partition.
To compute the lag we have to do a join using topic partition as key.

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/lag/ConsumerLagMain.java[tags=topicPartitionJoin]
----

As consumer lag is equal to _topic end offset - consumer current offset_,
computing it is straightforward:

== Conclusion

We managed to get consumer lag using the Java Kafka client API and a few lines of code.

However, I regret several things about this API:

. The `endOffsets` method is not in the `AdminClient` class.
    If it were the case, instantiating a consumer would be useless.
. We have to open two connections, and repeat twice the connection settings like `bootstrap.servers`,
    once for the admin client, then for the consumer client.
    It would be interesting if they could share options and may be even the TCP connection.
. `AdminClient` class often returns `KafkaFuture<Something>`,
    the API design is very different from `Consumer` and `Producer` clients.
    I wonder why they created a `KafkaFuture` class instead of reusing `CompletableFuture`.
