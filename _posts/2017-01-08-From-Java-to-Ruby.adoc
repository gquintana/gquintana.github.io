:page-description: "First impression of the Ruby Language."

One of my 2017 resolutions is to try different languages and see how they compare to Java.
This is inspired by the https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks[7 languages in 7 weeks] book by Bruce A. Tate.
I don't expect to learn a new language each week though, since it took me several weeks only for the first one.

The first language I've tried is Ruby.
I've already seen Ruby used many times: Vagrant configuration, Logstash plugins, FluentD plugins, web applications like Kibana 2...
But I don't have any experience in Ruby development.
So I used the http://rubykoans.com/[Ruby Koans] to teach myself Ruby.

## The good

### Syntactic sugar everywhere

Ruby has a lot of syntactic sugar which makes code really easy to read, and short to write.

The first example deals with arrays:
[source,ruby]
----
a=["one","two","three","four"]
puts a[1..-2] # <1>

first, *tail = a # <2>
----
<1> Prints two and three whose indices are between 1 and length-2
<2> The array is destructured: `first` contains one and `tail` an array of two, three, four

The second example shows the templating system in strings:
[source,ruby]
----
i=4
puts "Square root of #{i} is #{Math.sqrt(i)}" # <1>
----
<1> Prints _Square root of 4 is 2.0_

Now let's see getters and setters.
By default attributes a private, while methods are public:
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/getter_setter.rb[]
----
<1> Declare a getter, `return` is optional
<2> Declare a setter, notice this funny method name `name=`
<3> Call the setter
<4> Call the getter

I'll show later that getters and setters can be generated.

### Meta programming

Ruby has a powerful API similar to Java reflection:
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/reflect.rb[]
----
As the `say` method is not implemented, the `method_missing` is called.
You will notice that a method call is made of a `method_name`, an array of `arguments`, and a code `block` (I'll tell more on that later).
----
Hello
Call say with ["Goodbye"]
----
The above example shows how to generate methods in an existing class.
With this API, creating a proxy to wrap an object and do some kind of AOP is simple:
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/proxy.rb[]
----
<1> Check whether the target object has the method or not
<2> Call the method on the target object.
<3> Wrap the string in a proxy
----
Before upcase []
After upcase: HELLO WORLD!
HELLO WORLD!
----


## The bad

### Strings

Strings are mutable:
[source, ruby]
----
hi = "Hello "
hi << "world"
----
The above example is similar to a Java `StringBuilder`: at the end `hi` contains `Hello world`.
I know that having immutable Strings in Java allows many optimizations in the JVM, I wonder what's the performance penalty of having mutable strings.

Multiline strings is something I miss in Java, but Ruby's syntax is rather strange.
They are delimited with `%{ ... }` or `%! ... !` or ...:
[source, ruby]
----
multiline = %{
First line
Second line
}
----

### Unless

I am not a big fan of the `unless` keyword which does the contrary of `if`
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/control.rb[tags=unless1]
----
<1> Is the same as `if !rude`

Sticking to the `if` keyword looks like better option to me.

However, I have to admit that this syntax is not as bad:
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/control.rb[tags=unless2]
----

### Functional programming

Doing functional programming with Ruby is clearly possible.
But it doesn't look natural to me.

First the lambda functions syntax could be simpler:
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/functional.rb[tags=simple]
----
<1> Means x -> 2 * x
<2> The `call` method is used to invoke the function
<3> the `{ ... }` delimiter can be replaced by `do ... end` for multiline functions

Then, passing functions to methods uses a special feature.
Methods can receive a block of code as a special argument,
this block is then called using the `yield` keyword.
[source,ruby]
----
class Demo
  def say_hello
    if block_given?
      message = yield("Hello World!") # <2>
    else
      message = "Hello World!"
    end
    puts message
  end
  def yell_hello
    say_hello { |s| s.upcase } # <1>
  end
end
----
<1> Invoke the `say_hello` method if a block of code
<2> Invoke the block and pass it some parameters

I first wondered why the block wasn't passed as other method arguments,
and why it was handled as a special argument.
The reason is probably that it allows do "sandwich code":
[source,ruby]
----
open(file_name) do |file| # <1>
  # Do something with opened file
end # <2>
----
<1> Open the file named `file_name` and make it available to the block.
<2> Close the file

The `open` method takes two arguments the file name and the code block dealing with the file.
In the end, this looks like Java's try-with-resources statement.

### Open classes

Classes are open which means, anyone can add a method to any class, even system ones:
[source,ruby]
----
class ::Integer      # <1>
  def even?          # <2>
    (self % 2) == 0
  end
end

puts 1.even?         # <3>
----
<1> Let's add a method to integers
<2> Funny fact: in Ruby's naming conventions method returning a boolean should end with `?`
<3> Prints `false`

While it can be useful, placed in wrong hands, this weapon may be harmful.
Yet existing methods can not be replaced.

### Building and packaging

Ruby libraries and applications are packaged as _Gems_ which are Zip archives
containing code and metadata, a bit like Java's Jar files.

To start a Ruby project, 4 tools are needed:

* *Ruby*: there are multiple versions and variants (MRI, JRuby...) to choose from.
  *https://rvm.io[RVM]* (Ruby Version Manager) is an optional tool to install
  and activate the appropriate one.
* *Gem* is the tool to download gems from http://rubygems.org
  (which is a sort of Maven Central repository)
  and unzip them in the local repository.
  It's a package manager like Yum, NPM...
* *http://bundler.io[Bundler]* takes a bill of materials,
  the list of dependencies for the project,
  and runs Gem to download and install them.
* *http://www.rubyrake.org[Rake]*
  (Ruby Make) is Ruby build tool, it can process files, run unit tests...

And 2 files are need to describe a project:

* *Gemfile* contains the list of Gems needed to build and run the project. It's used by Bundler.
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/fizzbuzz/Gemfile[]
----
* *Rakefile* describes how to build the project. It's Rake configuration file.
[source,ruby]
----
include::{source_dir}/fizzbuzz/Rakefile[]
----

For the newcomer, starting a project is not a trivial task.
I had to read each tool documentation independently,
look for an example of each config file and assemble the whole.

## The odd

Objects have a numeric Id which can be used for reference comparison:
[source,ruby]
----
o=Object.new
puts o.object_id # <1>
----
<1> The object Id is a numeric value, for instance 4376500

### Symbols

I had hard time understanding the concept of *Symbol*.

A symbol is a kind of immutable and unique string which can be used as a constant or as a label.
[source, ruby]
----
color = :red
color = :blue
----
In this example, `red` and `blue` are symbols used as enum values.

Symbols are used with meta programming to identify methods, attributes and so forth:
[source, ruby]
----
class Person
  attr_reader :id  <1>
  attr_accessor :name <2>
end
----
<1> The `id` attribute is read-only, it has a setter
<2> The `name` attribute is read/write, it has a getter and a setter

Symbols are also used as hash map keys because they are unique:
[source, ruby]
----
ages = { :bob => 23, :john => 35 }
ages = { bob: 23, john: 35}
----
Since Ruby 2, the two above hashes are identical.


### Modules

Modules are a bit like Java packages, they are used as namespaces.

The weird part, is that a module can contain classes and a class can contain modules:
[source, ruby]
----
module Demo # <1>
  class Thing
    module Nameable # <2>
      def set_name(name)
        @name = name
      end
    end
  end
  class Pet < Thing
    include Thing::Nameable
  end
end

medor = Demo::Pet.new
medor.set_name("MÃ©dor") # <3>
----
<1> The `Demo` module is used as a _container_ for `Thing` and `Pet` classes.
<2> The `Nameable` module is used as a _mixin_.
<3> The `Pet` class as `set_name` method.

In fact a module and a class are close concepts, a class is a module which can be instiated.

## Conclusion

Ruby is close to Java because it has the same OOP roots: both are inspired by Smalltalk,
both were born in the nineties.

I don't pretend to be a Ruby expert at all, if I wrote something wrong, tell me.
