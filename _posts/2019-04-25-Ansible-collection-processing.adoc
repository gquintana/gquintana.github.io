:page-description: "How to filter and transform collections in Ansible playbooks."

As a Java developer, I sometimes dream that I can use the Java 8+ Stream API in my Ansible playbook to process list and dict variables.

In this article, I'll show you can process a list of users:
[source,yaml]
----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=list_var]
----

== Jinja Filters

The main tool to transform Ansible variables are Jinja filters. There are 2 libraries of filters available:

* The Jinja http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters[builtin filters].
  This list can also be found in Jinja source code https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/master/jinja2/filters.py[filters.py].
* The https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#[Ansible filters]
  This list can also be found in Ansible source code https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/filter[filter] directory.

Filters are similar to Unix or Anguler pipes and can be chained.

Like in other data processing libraries there two kinds of operators:

* *Mappers* take stream of element and produce a stream of elements: selectattr, rejectattr, map, list
* *Reducers:* take a stream of elements and produce a single element: join, first, last, max, min

[source,yaml]
----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=simple]
----
<1> Take the `id` attribute of `users` having `admin` set to true and join them.
<2> Take the `users` havin `admin` set to false and count them. As the `rejectattr` filter returns an iterator, but the `count` filter requires a list, I have to use `list` filter to convert it.

The `selectattr`/`rejectattr` filters can take 3 arguments: the attribute, a boolean operator and an argument.
The operator can be chosen among Jinja's http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#list-of-builtin-tests[builtin tests].
This list can also be found in Ansible source code https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/master/jinja2/filters.py[tests.py].
[source,yaml]
----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=select_advanced]
----

With Ansible 2.7+, the `map` filter can take 3 arguments: the attribute, an operator and arguments.
The operator can be chosen among Jinja filters, and will be applied to each element of the list.
[source,yaml]
----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=map_advanced]
----
<1> For each `users` take its name and when the regular expression matches  apply the replacement, then join the result.

== JSON Query

Another strategy is to use a JSON Path to walk down the YAML tree.
It's bit less verbose and bit more powerful than the previous solution.

[source,yaml]
----
include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=json_query]
----
<1> Take the `id` attributes of `users` having `admin` set to true and then join them.
<2> Take the `id` attributes of `users` having `role` set to `assistant` and then join them.

This `json_query` is based on the `jmespath` Python https://pypi.org/project/jmespath/[library], this means 2 things:

. You can use http://jmespath.org/[jmespath.org] web site to cook your JSON path query.
. You'll have to add the `jmespath` library to your Python environnement.

Sadly, nesting JMESPath expressions inside Jinja template expressions inside YAML files can be tricky.
This following example fails, even if the JMES path is alright in Python interpreter.
[source,yaml]

include::{source_dir}/group_vars/all.yml[tags=json_query_error]

== Conclusion

It's possible to transform a variable containing an array into another list.
However it's still painful to do because neither YAML nor Jinja tare programming languages.
I personnaly regret I can't invoke Python code from Ansible playbook and use for comprehensions, imagine something like:
[source,yaml]
----
py_admin_user_ids: |
  {{ ','.join([ user.id for user in users if user.admin ]) }}
----
