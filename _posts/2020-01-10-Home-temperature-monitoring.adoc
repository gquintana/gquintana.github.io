I had an unused Raspberry Pi 3 and some free time during holidays.
Here is what I built to monitor temperature and humidity.
It's just a working prototype but it was both simple and fun to do.

I used Grafana and InfluxDB because both run on ARM and Raspberry,
and are very easy to set up.
Both use the Go language, so no specific runtime environment is needed.

== Hardware

It all started with the https://www.raspberryweather.com/[Raspberry Weather] web site,
which brought me to the DHT22 and DS18B20 sensors.

I bought the temperature module from https://www.az-delivery.com/products/dht22-temperatursensor-modul[AZ Delivery].
It's a DHT22 (AM2302) temperature and humidity sensor soldered on tiny board with a small resistance.
As a result, all you need is provided (even jumper wires), you don't need anything else: no breadboard, no resistance...
AZ Delivery also provides some documentation about their product as a PDF https://www.az-delivery.com/products/dht-22-modul-kostenfreies-e-book[e-book].
which explains how to plug this module on either an Arduino or a Raspberry.

I used the Raspberry Pi 3 I had, but a smaller or older board should be enough.

== Software

=== Raspbian

First I flashed a brand new Raspbian Buster on the micro SD card.
The image can be downloaded https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/[on Raspberry Pi web site].
With https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md[raspi-config] I configured the network (WiFi),
and enabled SSH.

=== InfluxDB

Then I installed InfluxDB on the Raspbian, by adding the InfluxData Debian repository

./etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list
[source,ini]
----
deb https://repos.influxdata.com/debian buster stable
----

[source,shell]
----
curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install influxdb
sudo systemctl start influxdb
----

To check that InfluxDB is running, you can cUrl it:

[source,shell]
----
curl -s -v http://localhost:8086/ping
...
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Content-Type: application/json
< Request-Id: c28feb69-30bc-11ea-8628-b827eb3ca438
< X-Influxdb-Build: OSS
< X-Influxdb-Version: 1.7.9
----

=== Grafana

As Grafana is concerned, I downloaded the .deb file and installed it as described
on https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=arm[Grafana web site]
[source,shell]
----
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-rpi_6.5.2_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i grafana-rpi_6.5.2_armhf.deb
----

Grafana service is not enabled nor started by default.

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
----

To check that Grafana is running, you can open a browser on http://myraspberry.local:3000,
and log in.
The default admin/admin user account can be changed in `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` config file.

== Code

The code reads temperature and humidity from the sensor every minute or so.
And then writes the result in the InfluxDB database.

I hesitated to do it with Go language,
but I chose Python because I immediately found simple code examples.

=== Python

To boostrap my Python environment, I installed several packages:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-openssl \
  python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-wheel python3-yaml python3-influxdb
----

To read from my DHT22 sensor, I used the https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT[Adafruit_Python_DHT] package even if it's deprecated.
I'll try to use the newer https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT[Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT] package later.

[source,shell]
----
sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
----

The code I wrote is based on provided https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/tree/master/examples[code samples].

To write into the InfluxDB database I used the official Python client.
Its documentation can be found https://influxdb-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[here].
The code I wrote is based on provided https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-python/tree/master/examples[code samples].

== Sources

The InfluxDB database can be created with `influx` CLI tool

[source]
----
influx -execute 'create database dht22'
----

The sources are https://github.com/gquintana/gquintana.github.io/tree/develop/sources/2020-01-10-Home-temperature-monitoring[here],
there are 3 files:

* `dht22.py`: The Python code to read DHT22 sensor and write the result into InfluxDB
* `dht22.yml`: The config file telling where the sensor is plugged and which database to use.
* `dht22.service`: The service unit to place in `/etc/systemd/system` to automatically start `dht22.py` when Raspberry Pi boots.

I had 2 kinds of problems:

. There were holes in the graphs because the polling loop was stuck for more than a minute.
  At the moment, I ignore why.
. The sensor returned out of range values (3200% humidity, -10Â°C inside).
  So I added measure validation to avoid weird graphs.
