Ansible is a nice tool to deploy distributed systems like Elasticsearch, Kafka, Cassandra and the like.
These systems are built with high availability in mind,
they can tolerate partial failures.
Upgrading these software, or updating their configuration, requires restarting each member of the cluster.

The aim of this article is to describe a pattern I discovered
trying to improve deployment speed of Ansible playbooks
and yet being able to guarantee availability during this upgrade process.
To improve deployment, you need to deploy all hosts in parallel.
To guarantee availability, you can't stop all host at the same time: you must deploy each host one after the other.

== The problem

Let's take the Elasticsearch example.

The tasks required to deploy Elasticsearch on each host of the cluster are gathered in an `elasticsearch` role.
In short, a role is a recipe to install and update an Elasticsearch node.
Once declared, this role is applied to all hosts belonging to the `elasticsearch` group in the Ansible playbook.

.playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
----

At some point, the `elasticsearch` role will probably contain something to stop Elasticsearch in order for changes to be reloaded:

.roles/elasticsearch/tasks/main.yml
[source,yaml]
----
...
- name: Stop service
  become: true
  service:
    name: elasticsearch
    state: stopped
    enabled: true
...
----

This naive Ansible playbook will stop all Elasticsearch nodes at the same time, making the whole cluster unavailable until nodes are started again.
To fix this problem, the role can be ran in serial instead of parallel:

.deploy.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: es
  serial: 1 # Force serial execution
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
----

But deploying every host, one after the other (in serial), takes a very long time and makes deployment endless.

== Refactoring the role

The main idea to improve speed is to split the role into multiple steps, and do as much as possible in parallel:

1. *In Parallel*: Deploy system settings, software settings, software binaries.
  But don't stop anything and don't remove anything at this point.
2. *In Serial*:
  * Stop the node
  * Install or upgrade the node as quickly as possible, do as few things as possible.
  * Start the node
3. *In Parallel*: finish applying settings on a running cluster and remove old files and binaries.

Then describe each step in its own YAML file: `before.yml`, `stop_start.yml` and `after.yml`.
Finally, the role entry point `main.yml` will include the appropriate step using a variable named `elasticsearch_step`:

.roles/elasticsearch/tasks/main.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- name: "Running step {{ elasticsearch_step }}"
  include: "{{ elasticsearch_step }}.yml"
----

We can also create a fake step including all the steps (more on that later):

.roles/elasticsearch/tasks/all.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- include: "before.yml"
- include: "stop_start.yml"
- include: "after.yml"
----

== Refactoring the playbook

Now, in the playbook we will call the role 3 times, each individual step being called independently.

.playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# In parallel
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "before"

# In serial
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  serial: 1
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "stop_start"

# In parallel
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "after"
----

To install a brand new cluster, there is nothing to stop, and we don't fear anything.
In this particular case, this role can still be used, and the `stop_start` step can be called in parallel:

.playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# New cluster
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "before"
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "stop_start"
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "after"
----

Or even simpler, we can use the `all` step:

.playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# New cluster
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "all"
----

You may have noticed the `serial` attribute is a number, I set to 1.
For big clusters, and provided you have more than one replica of your data,
you can stop'n'start nodes two by two, three by three...

== Unreloaded configuration

Most of the time, I am only running the Ansible playbook to change settings that don't need nodes to be restarted.
To skip the expensive part, the trick is to detect in the `before` step whether nodes should be restarted or not.
A a result, the `before` step should mark whether the `stop_start` is required:

.roles/elasticsearch/tasks/before.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- set_fact:
    elasticsearch_restart_needed: True
----

Then on lucky days, you can skip the expensive `stop_start` step and have a quick and fully parallel deployment.

Other days, when upgrading nodes version, or changing configuration which can not be hot reloaded, running the Ansible playbook will be slower.
Node specific configuration (`elasticsearch.yml`, Kafka `server.properties`...) is usually part of the problem as it requires node restart.

.playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: elasticsearch
  any_errors_fatal: true
  serial: 1
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      elasticsearch_step: "stop_start"
  when: elasticsearch_restart_needed defined and elasticsearch_restart_needed
----



== Cluster wide configuration

In distributed systems, some configuration must be done once for the whole cluster.
Here are some examples:

* *Elasticsearch*: License, Users and grants, Indices, Mappings, Templates, Cluster settings (allocation awareness, minimum master nodes...)
* *Kafka*: Users and grants, Topics
* *Cassandra*: Users and grants, Keyspaces, Tables

Obviously, this kind of configuration must be ran in the `after` once the cluster is started and listening.

.roles/elasticsearch/tasks/after.yml
[source,yaml]
----
- uri:
    url: "http://{{ ansible_ssh_hostname }}:9200/article"
    method: PUT
    body_format: json
    body: "{{ lookup('file','article_setting.json') }}"
  run_once: true
----

The trick here is to use `run_once` to play this task on a single node.
