:page-description: "How to convert Java 7- File code to Java 8+ Path code"

I've been using `java.io.File` and `java.io.File*Stream` since Java 1.1, a long time ago.
Java 7 introduced a new file API named *NIO2* containing, among others, the `java.nio.file.Path` and `java.nio.file.Files` classes.
It took me a while to lose my habits and embrace the new API.

Spoiler: The most funny part of this article isÂ at the end!

|     java.io.File (class)                |     java.nio.file.Path (interface)
| file = new File("path/to/file.txt")     | path = Paths.get("path/to/file.txt")
| file = new File(parentFile, "file.txt") | path = parentPath.resolve("file.txt")
| file.getFileName()                      | path.getFileName().toString()
| file.getParentFile()                    | path.getParent()
| file.mkdirs()                           | Files.createDirectories(path)
| file.length()                           | Files.size(path)
| file.exists()                           | Files.exists(path)
| file.delete()                           | Files.delete(path)
| new FileOutputStream(file)              | Files.newOutputStream(path)
| new FileInputStream(file)               | Files.newInputStream(path)
| file.listFiles(filter)                  | Files.list(path) .filter(filter) .collect(toList())

Some additional notes:

* `Path` throws `IOException` more often than `File`, and rarely return a `boolean` to tell if something was done (`mkdirs()`, `delete()`)
* `File` is more object oriented than `Path`: I regret that `size()`, `exists()`... methods are not on the `Path` interface. This is probably due to the fact that this API was added in Java 7, but default methods on interfaces were added later in Java 8.
* `Path` based `InputStream`/`OutputStream`s are less expensive from a GC point view. Thanks https://twitter.com/thekittster/status/905326864251670532[@kittster] for mentionning https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-considered-harmful[this article from Cloudbees].

== One liners

`java.nio.file.Files` allows to read, write, copy files in a single line:

[source,java]
----
Files.write(Paths.get("image.png"), bytes); // <1>

List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("letter.txt"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // <2>

Files.lines(Paths.get("letter.txt"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
		.forEach(System.out::println);
----
<1> Write a binary file
<2> Read a text file

This nearly makes Guava IO and Commons IO  useless. I regret that there isn't any method out of the box to read/write a whole file as a single string.

Many APIs (JAXB, Jackson to name a few) don't use `Path`s to read/write files, the workaround is usually use an `InputStream` or an `OutputStream`.

[source,java]
----
try(InputStream inputStream = Files.newInputStream(path)) {
  Thing thing = (Thing) unmarshaller.unmarshal(inputStream);
}
----

== Multiple file systems

When the `File` is only for local files, `Path` can also be used to access remote files.
A `Path` is associated to a `FileSystem`.

To create a new `Path` instances, there is not constructor (`Path` is interface), we need to call a factory method. The above 2 lines are the same:

[source,java]
----
path = Paths.get("path/to/file.txt");
path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("path/to/file.txt");
----

As the default file system is the local one, you get a path to a local file.
Depending on the underlying file system, you'll get a different implementation: `sun.nio.fs.UnixPath`, `sun.nio.fs.WindowsPath`...

With this trick in mind, we can read the content of a Zip file, as if we had extracted it:

[source,java]
----
URI zipUri = new URI("jar:file:/path/to/archive.zip")
try(FileSystem zipFS = FileSystems.newFileSystem(zipUri, emptyMap())) { // <1>
    Path zipPath = zipFS.getPath("/archive") // <2>
	Files.list(zipPath)
		.map(Path::toString)
		.forEach(System.out::println);
}
----
<1> "Mount" the Zip file as a file system
<2> `zipPath` is of type `com.sun.nio.zipfs.ZipPath`

You can even plug additional file systems: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/io/fsp/zipfilesystemprovider.html[ZIP], https://github.com/maddingo/nio-fs-provider[SFTP, SMB, WebDAV], https://github.com/lucastheisen/jsch-nio[SSH/SCP], https://github.com/Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2[Amazon S3], https://github.com/google/jimfs[In memory], https://github.com/damiencarol/jsr203-hadoop[HDFS], ...
This almost means you can read a remote file as if it were local.
