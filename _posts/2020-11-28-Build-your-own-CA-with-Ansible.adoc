:page-description: "How to generate certificates with your own CA."

Securing your Kafka, Elasticsearch, Cassandra or whatever distributed software means using SSL (also known as TLS) to encrypt communications:

* Node to node communication
* Client to node communication

Setting up SSL means providing SSL  certificates for each node.
Generating SSL certificate is a cumbersome task:

* The https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_ssl[Kafka documentation] describes extensively the process.
* Elasticsearch brings its own https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/configuring-tls.html#node-certificates[elasticsearch-certutil] tool.
* Datastax also https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.x/cassandra/configuration/secureSSLCertWithCA.html[documents] a similar process for Cassandra

I will describe here how to generate a SSL certificate for each node using Ansible,
because I am also deploying Kafka, Elasticsearch and the like with Ansible.

There are several important rules to know when generating certificates:

* The name present in the certificate, must match the public name of the host.
    We can not share the same certificate on all nodes, unless using star certificates.
    Any TLS client connecting to a node, will check that certificate name and host name matches, unless disabling host name verification.
* The name present in the certificate, should match the reverse DNS name corresponding IP of the host.
    Java clients connecting to a node, will do a reverse DNS lookup to get the public name of the host they are connecting to.

These two rules are meant to prevent *Man in the middle* attacks. 
A TLS certificate allows to check you're talking to the wanted target, 
not something in between which could spy and steal information.

When a machine has multiple names (think about DNS aliases, virtual hosts), a certificate can contain multiple names.
The main name is called CN (Common Name), 
while other names are called SAN (Subject Alt Names).

== The certificate authority

As Kafka or Elasticsearch clusters should never be publicly exposed,
using a public certificate authority (Thawte, Verisign and the like) is not necessary.
A self-signed certificate authority local to the cluster or the environment (Dev, Q/A) should be enough.

So the first step is to create a certificate authority which will be used to sign the certificates of all hosts belonging to our cluster.
As this step will be done only once, I won't automate it.

$ mkdir ownca

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:FR <5>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:.
Locality Name (eg, city) []:.
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:eNova Conseil
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:.
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Root
Email Address []:rootca@enova-conseil.com
----
<1> The CA root certificate will last 5 years
<2> This certificate will be used as a CA
<3> Generate both key and self-signed certificate
<4> Password to protect the key
<5> Information describing the Root certificate

For safety reasons, the generated key should be kept secret and stored in secure place:

* It must not be transfered to target Kafka servers
* It must not be kept in source control (Git)

== The nodes certificates

This is were Ansible comes in.
As your cluster might have many nodes, automating certificate generation makes sense.
For each target host, I will repeat the same process:

image::{image_dir}/process.svg[Process]

. On the target host, generate a key `target.key` and an CSR  (Certificate signing request) `target.csr`
. Pull the CSR on the control host. 
. Sign the CSR with the CA key.
  This will generate a certificate `target.crt`.
. Push the generated certificate `target.crt` on the target host.
  The CA certificate `root.crt` is also pushed.

As the TLS keys `.key` are sensitive, they do not travel, they stay where they were generated.
On the contrary, certificates `.crt` and CSRs `.csr` only contain public information.

Once you have the key, the cert and CA certs on the target host, you can start using them:

[source,yaml]

include::{source_dir}/openssl/tasks/main.yml[tags=after]

The produced PKCS12 file can be used as a Java Keystore.

The attentive reader has noticed I am using a bunch of `openssl_xxx` Ansible modules (namely `openssl_privatekey`, `openssl_csr`, `openssl_certificate` and `openssl_pkcs12`).
These modules requires to have openssl and PyOpenSSL installed on each host.
