You're developping a Java application plugged to Kafka, 
or maybe you're programming a data processing pipeline based on Kafka Streams. How do you automate tests involving both Java code and Kafka brokers?

Such an integration tests should be able to

. Start Zookeeper and then Kafka
. Send messages into Kafka so as to trigger business code
. Consume messages from Kafka and check their content
. Stop Kafka and then Zookeeper

== Kafka embedded in the test

As both Kafka and Zookeeper are Java applications, it is possible to control them from Java code. It is possible (have a look at https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-kafka/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/kafka/embedded/EmbeddedKafkaBroker.java[camel-kafka] or https://github.com/danielwegener/logback-kafka-appender/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/danielwegener/logback/kafka/util/EmbeddedKafkaCluster.java[logback-kafka-appender]), but is not easy.

There are many libraries to run an embedded Kafka from JUnit without sweating:

* https://github.com/charithe/kafka-junit[Kafka JUnit] by Charith Ellawala
* Another https://mguenther.github.io/kafka-junit/[Kafka JUnit] by Markus GÃ¼nther
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.2.6.RELEASE/reference/html/#testing[Spring Kafka Test] by the Spring team

The drawback of this solution is that Kafka and Zookeeper servers are started in the same JVM as your test.
So one can fear unexpected behaviour.

=== Kafka JUnit

Charith's Kafka JUnit library is one of the most simple and efficient.
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/pom.xml[tags=charithe]
----

This library supports both JUnit 4 & 5.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/test/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/CharitheMessageServiceIT.java[tags=start]
----
<1> Load JUnit 5 extension that will start an embedded Kafka
<2> A `kafkaHelper` is injected to get embedded Kafka address

This `KafkaHelper` contains several methods to easily produce and consume messages
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/test/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/CharitheMessageServiceIT.java[tags=api]
----
<1> Start a non blocking consumer
<2> Produce some messages in a Topic

=== Spring Kafka Test

Spring Kafka Test is an addition to Spring Kafka library.
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/pom.xml[tags=spring-kafka]
----

This library supports only JUnit 4 at the moment, 
as a result it contains a JUnit Rule to handle embedded Kafka lifecycle.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/test/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/SpringMessageServiceIT.java[tags=start]
----
<1> JUnit 4 Rule that will start an embedded Kafka and create a topic.
<2> The `kafka` rule is used to get the embedded Kafka address.

Spring Kafka Test contains a `KafkaTestUtils` class which is a swiss army knife to write Kafka related tests. 
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/test/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/SpringMessageServiceIT.java[tags=api]
----
<1> Use `KafkaTestUtils` to create a consumer.
<2> Use `KafkaTestUtils` along with the usual `KafkaTemplate` to quickly send messages.
<3> Use `KafkaTestUtils` to quickly consume messages.
<4> The `KafkaConditions` integrates with AssertJ to make received messages simpler.

Spring Kafka Test is probably the way to go when you're developping a Spring application. 
However this library lacks some syntactic sugar to make tests more readable.

== Kafka in docker

https://www.testcontainers.org/[Test containers] purpose is to start Docker containers from JUnit to do integration tests with any product: MySQL, Elasticsearch, Kafka... There is a base module, a Kafka extension and a JUnit 5 extension. 
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/pom.xml[tags=containers]
----

Testcontainers library is strongly integrated with JUnit 5, a single annotation and you're done. A JUnit 4 rule is also available.
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/test/java/com/github/gquintana/kafka/ContainersMessageServiceIT.java[tags=start]
----
<1> Trigger Testcontainers start
<2> Create a Kafka container. 
	By default the https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka[cp-kafka Docker image] created by Confluent is used. 
    As a consequence the version number matches the Confluent Platform version, not Apache Kafka.
    
As Testcontainers is a generic library to run containers,
there is no helper class to read/write messages.
Starting a Docker container is slower than starting an embedded Kafka,
but process isolation is stronger.
You are starting the real thing, no hacked Kafka broker, so you are closer to production.
3 Dockers containers are actually used by Testcontainers Kafka.

== Kafka Consumer subscriptions

Dealing with asynchronous code in tests is often painful, Kafka consumers don't help.

It can take a long time for the consumer group controller to be elected, and partitions to be assigned. 
Between the consumer bootstrap and the first messages being received,
it can take a second or so.

Using a `ConsumerRebalanceListener` to wait for partitions to be assigned and check which ones are assigned can be useful.

The http://www.awaitility.org/[Awaitility] library can aleviate the burden of asynchronous testing.
