:page-description: This my first blog post about using HubPress.

This is my first post on this blog.

I am trying out http://hubpress.io[HubPress.io] and I'm just amazed:

- 5 minutes to setup un blog site on GitHub.
- A neat backoffice to administrate it
- Posts written in AsciiDoc with live preview.
- Built with cool tech: React, Redux,
- Mostly built in France: cock-a-doodle-doo
