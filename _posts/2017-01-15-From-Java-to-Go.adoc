:page-description: "First impression of the Go Language."

This is the second episode of my _7 languages in 7 weeks_ series of blog posts.
After link:2017-01-08-From-Java-to-Ruby.html[Ruby], a language which is more than 20 years old,
I tried a more recent language, Go which was created in 2009.

Go gained in traction thanks to the Docker ecosystem:
Docker container engine, Kubernetes, https://traefik.io/[Traefik] are mostly developed in Go.

== The good

=== Simple to learn

Even if the language is pretty recent, there are many resources to learn Go.
The first one I stumbled upon was https://tour.golang.org/[Tour of Go],
it allows to discover the Go features and test them online.
You can even run the web server locally if you want to learn Go while traveling,
it has even been translated in many languages. In a word, awesome!

I also tried the https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans[Go Koans],
but the tests are less detailed and progressive than Ruby Koans.
It took me an evening to complete these exercises.

There are several free e-books to get started with Go:

* http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro[Introduction to Programming in Go] by Caleb Doxsey
* http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/[The Little Go Book] by Karl Seguin
* http://www.golangbootcamp.com/[Go BootCamp] by Matt Aimonetti

Go is mostly simple to grasp because there are few concepts.
The Go Lang spec is less 100 pages long.

Obviously the "Go" name is not SEO friendly, you'd better google "GoLang" instead.

=== Rich tooling

As soon as you've installed Go and without any extra step, you can:

* *Get* libraries (Go packages) with a sort of package manager
* *Format* code to stick to Go formatting rules
* *Compile* code and link dependencies.
  I was amazed to see how fast it was to compile a simple app and run it.
* *Run* unit tests.
  Go provides a unit testing package, sadly it's not as powerful as others XUnit libraries.
* *Analyze* code and detect suspicious constructs.
* *Search and Read* the base API documentation while being offline.

Sadly, there is no https://github.com/blindpirate/report-of-go-package-management-tool[official tool] to manage project dependencies
and download them with Go Get.

=== `switch` statement

Compare Go's switch statement
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/switch.go[tags=main]
----
With Java's
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/Switch.java[tags=main]
----
The `fallthrough` keyword does the exact opposite of `break`.
This looks like a better default than Java to me,
because most of the time you don't want to run multiple cases.
A missing `break` can raise subtle bugs.

This `switch` statement, can also replace a bunch of `if`/`else if` statements:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/switch.go[tags=pattern]
----
This looks like pattern matching, but simpler and less powerful.

=== Concurrency with channels and routines

First of all, a *channel* is a concept used for inter-thread communication.
There are 2 types of channels:

* *Sync channels* are similar to Java's `SynchronousQueue` ,
the producer waits for the consumer to be ready:
+
[source,go]
----
ch := make(chan string)
----
* *Async channels* are similar to Java's `ArrayBlockingQueue` ,
the producer waits for a free location to place data,
while the consumer waits for a place filled with data:
+
[source,go]
----
ch := make(chan string, 10)
----

*Goroutines* are lightweight threads, to run the `doit` function in background:
[source,go]
----
go doit()
----

In the following example, a thread will generate and send numbers to another thread.
The receiver thread will multiply the numbers and print them:

image::{image_dir}/concurrency.svg[Channels and Goroutines]

[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/concurrency.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Generate and append data in the channel. This function will run in a first thread.
<2> Pull data from the channel and process it. This function will run in a second thread.
<3> Run the `multiply` function in a background thread
<4> Run the `generate` function in the main thread.
   I could have placed it in a separate thread as well.

This multi-threading pattern, called CSP (communicating sequential processes) looks bit like Actor model (Akka and the like).
An actor is more or less an async channel with a goroute polling from this channel, like the `multiply` function.

== The bad

=== Error handling

There has been http://openmymind.net/Golangs-Error-Handling-Good-And-Bad/[debate] about how errors are handled.
I hope not to start a new troll with this paragraph.

Prior to explaining my grief with error handling, let me talk about multiple values.
A function can return multiple values, however there are no tuples like in Python, Scala...
[source,go]
----
file, err := ioutil.ReadFile("file.txt") // Correct
tuple :=     ioutil.ReadFile("file.txt") // Incorrect
----
I can not assign both values to a single variable.

Now, let's come back to error handling. In Go there is no Exception concept, you must use multiple return values:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/error_handling.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Function can raise an error
<2> Raise an error
<3> Return normal result
<4> Propagate the error
<5> Handle normal flow
<6> Handle error flow

To me, this means multiple things

* In the `Order` function, I must *always* return 2 things: `nil+error` (1) or `result+nil` (2).
  I can even return both `result+error`.
* I need to *manually* propagate the error when it occurs (3).
  Yet the function signature warns me that I may have to do something,
  and I can't hardly forget to deal with it.
* Even if I forward the error, the error doesn't contain *any call stack*.
  As a result, it's probably harder to debug since you don't know at first sight who
  first returned the error (5).
  Hopefully the https://github.com/go-errors/error[go-errors] library may help.
* I can not easily chain function calls
  because I can not write `Order(3).Print()` or `Print(Order(3))` where `Print` is a function to display the result of `Order`.

=== Pointers

Pointers are not a bad thing per se.
In my case, C/C++ lectures were far away in my memory.
It was not easy to remember the traps and tricks:
Should I pass this variable by reference or by value?

[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/pointer.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Happily, I don't have to convert the pointer into value to access the `Price` field.
   I don't have to write `*a.Price` or `a->Price` like in C++
<2> The article price is still 25 because it was passed by value
<3> Here I have to convert the value into a pointer
<4> The article price is now 27 because it was passed by reference
<5> Unlike C, the function can return a pointer to the created article
<6> `p` is a pointer to the created article

Having to deal with pointers, I felt like doing a step backward.

=== `make`, `new` and `New`

To create, I mean allocate, something there are several operators depending on the type
and whether you are expecting a pointer or not.
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/make_new.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Create a new struct and initialize its fields
<2> Create a new struct and return a pointer
<3> Create a new array and initialize its elements
<4> Create a new array and return an pointer
<5> Create a new slice
<6> Create a new map and initialize its elements
<7> Create a new map
<8> Create a new struct `Error` and initialize it

The `new` operator always returns a pointer, it's like a `malloc` operator in C.
The `make` operator is used to create data structures like slices, maps...
Neither the `new` nor the `make` operators can be passed values,
they are initialized with zeros and empty strings.
The `New` function is a factory, it can contain code to initialize or build something.

I find it a bit disturbing to have different syntaxes to do mostly the same thing.
For a language which aims at simplicity, this is baffling.

Most of the time, when creating a struct, you will initialize its fields
and get a pointer to avoid copying the value.
As a result, the main syntax is:
[source,go]
----
struct := &Language{"go", "Go Lang"}
----

=== Harsh compiler

The Go compiler is very strict, this can be good thing at times as it may prevent bugs.
But it can also be a bit too picky and annoying at times.
In particular, it doesn't accept unused variables and unused imports.
This is a rather common scenario when you are refactoring, looking for the cleanest code design or trying to implement an idea.
The compiler could just warn and skip unused declarations.

To skip a useless import, one can write (notice the underscore):
[source,go]
----
import _ "fmt"
----

Using an IDE (like Jetbrains Gogland) with an intelligent coding assistant
which would fix automatically imports may help.
I also found the https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports[goimports] command line tool,
but I didn't try it.

== The odd

Characters are called *Runes* in the Go terminology.
But they don't hide any secret magic ;-) .

=== `if` and `for` statements

The `for` statement uses the usual syntax minus the parenthesis:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/decl_if.go[tags=for]
----

Like in the above `for` construct, the `if` can declare a variable before the mandatory condition:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/decl_if.go[tags=main]
----
The `dice` variable is visible in the while `if`/`else` bloc.
I find the `if` statement to be less readable because
the `dice` declaration adds noise, and the condition doesn't catch my eye.

There is no `while` statement, `for` is the only loop keyword
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/loops.go[tags=main]
----
<1> The `for` with a condition acts as like the `while` in most languages
<2> I can not chain `ReadString` and `TrimSpace` functions in single line
    because the read can return an error I should have handled.
    This is the problem I explained with error handling and method chaining.

=== The `:=` symbol

The `:=` symbol is called _short variable declaration_,
it triggers type inference so you don't have to declare the type of your local variable.
[source,go]
----
var i int = 12
i := 12
----
Both variable declaration are the same.

I just wonder why there is a special symbol for that, even if I found it very efficient in practice.
At first, I thought it was to tell apart assignment from comparison (`==`) like in Pascal.

=== Packages and imports

I wonder why imported packages are strings wrapped by double quotes:
[source,go]
----
import "fmt"
----

Like Java, Go's package naming convention reflects domain names and folder paths:
[source,go]
----
import "github.com/go-errors/errors"
----

Moreover, when there are subpackages, only the last part of the package is used in the code:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/subpackage.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Notice that the imported package is named `io/ioutil` not `io/util`.
<2> To use a function in this package, I use `ioutil.Readfile` and skip the `io` prefix.

Naming a package `util`( or `common` or ...) in Go is probably a poor idea.
For instance `string/util` would be conflicting with `date/util`,
unless you give an alias to the import, but it looks less convenient:
[source,go]
----
import stringutil "string/util"
----

The Go compiler doesn't allow circular dependencies in packages which sounds like a good idea.

=== Structs and interfaces

Go doesn't have classes, inheritance and OOP concepts, but it doesn't matter,
structs are powerful and can have interfaces.
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/objects.go[tags=main]
----
<1> I wonder why the `NewPerson` constructor and the `GetName` function can not declared inside the struct.
<2> In the `GetName` function, the Go Linter warns that the `Person` argument shouldn't be named `this` or `self`, this is why I named it `p`.
<3> Notice the `Person` struct doesn't tell it implements the `Nameable` interface.
<4> A function should never take a pointer to an interface,
    because an interface is already a https://research.swtch.com/interfaces[kind of pointer] delegating to the original struct.
<5> The variable `p` of type `*Person` is automatically converted into `Nameable` interface.
    Go is doing duck typing, if it has a `GetName` function, then it is a `Nameable` thing.



== Conclusion

To me, the Go language is well suited for low level tools
(container orchestrators, databases, proxies...), command line utilities
as well as embedded and mobile applications.
But it is not has expressive as many other languages for business applications.

I don’t pretend to be a Go expert at all, if I wrote something wrong, tell me.
