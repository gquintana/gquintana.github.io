You wrote a piece of Logstash configuration which can parse some logs.
You tested several corner cases to ensure the output in Elasticsearch was alright.
How do you protect this clever configuration file against regressions?

Unit testing to the rescue of course!


== Simple example

For the sake of simplicity, we will take an obvious example: access logs.
The input looks like

----
172.17.0.1 - - [05/Sep/2016:20:06:17 +0000] "GET /images/logos/hubpress.png HTTP/1.1" 200 5432 "http://localhost/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/51.0.2704.79 Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36" "-"
----

The output, once in Elasticsearch, should look like

[source,json]
----
{ "@version":"1",
  "@timestamp":"2016-09-05T20:06:17.000Z",
  "type":"nginx",
  "host":"nginx-server", "path":"/var/log/nginx/access.log",
  "clientip":"172.17.0.1", "ident":"-", "auth":"-",
  "verb":"GET","request":"/images/logos/hubpress.png","httpversion":"1.1",
  "response":200, "bytes":5432, "referrer":"\"http://localhost/\"",
  "agent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/51.0.2704.79 Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36\""
}
----

The configuration could look like

[source,ruby]
----
input {
    file {
        path => "/var/log/nginx/access*.log"
        type => "nginx"
    }
}
filter {
    if [type] == "nginx" {
        grok {
            match => [ "message" , "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}"]
        }
        date {
            match => [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z" ]
        }
        mutate {
            convert => ["response", "integer"]
            convert => ["bytes", "integer"]
        }
    }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
      hosts => [ "es-server"]
      index => "logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
      document_type => "%{type}"
    }
}
----

== Split the file

In the above config file, the interesting part, the one containing logic is the filter part.
In order to test it, the first thing to do is split this big file into small pieces:

- `01_logstash_input_nginx.conf` contains the nginx file input
- `02_logstash_filter_nginx.conf` contains the nginx filter section
- `03_logstash_output.conf` contains the elasticsearch output

In production, you can load multiple config files as if they were a single one:

----
logstash agent -f /etc/logstash.d/*.conf"
----

At test time, by picking a single configuration file `02_logstash_filter_nginx.conf`, the Nginx log parsing can be tested in isolation.

== Write the unit test

Now let's test the `02_logstash_filter_nginx.conf` file alone and write a simple Ruby test case.
As you may know, Logstash is written in JRuby.

[source,ruby]
.02_logstash_filter_nginx_spec.rb
----
include::{sourcedir}/2016-09-07-Testing-Logstash-configuration/spec/02_logstash_nginx_filter_spec.rb[]
----
<1> Load configuration file
<2> Inject input event/message into the pipeline
<3> Check the ouput event/message properties

This test uses the JRuby testing framework called RSpec (`describe` method).
The `config` and `sample` functions are located in the https://github.com/elastic/logstash-devutils[Logstash DevUtils] library.
The `insist` and `reject` functions are part of the https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-insist[Ruby Insist] assertion library.

== Run the unit tests

First we will need to download and install additional development libraries like those mentioned above.

----
$ logstash-2.4.0/bin/logstash-plugin install --development
Installing logstash-devutils, logstash-input-generator, logstash-codec-json, logstash-output-null, logstash-filter-mutate, flores, rspec, stud, pry, rspec-wait, childprocess, ftw, logstash-output-elasticsearch, rspec-sequencing, gmetric, gelf, timecop, jdbc-derby, docker-api, logstash-codec-plain, simplecov, coveralls, longshoreman, rumbster, logstash-filter-kv, logstash-filter-ruby, sinatra, webrick, poseidon, logstash-output-lumberjack, webmock, logstash-codec-line, logstash-filter-grok
Installation successful
----

Now we can run the test, Logstash comes with a `rspec` command to run these spec files.

----
$ logstash-2.4.0/bin/rspec 02_logstash_nginx_filter_spec.rb
Using Accessor#strict_set for specs
Run options: exclude {:redis=>true, :socket=>true, :performance=>true, :couchdb=>true, :elasticsearch=>true, :elasticsearch_secure=>true, :export_cypher=>true, :integration=>true, :windows=>true}
.

Finished in 0.115 seconds (files took 0.784 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 4384
----

The `rspec` command can also run multiple tests at once.

----
$ logstash-2.4.0/bin/rspec spec -P '**/*_spec.rb'
----

To prevent test dependencies, they are randomly ordered: This called randomized testing.
